This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programming: division by zero. The `bug.cob` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides a corrected version with improved error handling.  The program attempts to divide 10 by 0, which causes a runtime error. The solution adds checks to prevent this.
